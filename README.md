## Seven Languages in Seven Weeks - aviatesk

My notes of https://www.amazon.co.jp/７つの言語-７つの世界-Bruce-Tate/dp/4274068579.

### Ruby

- has lots of things in common with julia:
  * `do ... end` (code block) syntax
  * external method definition
  * metaprogramming
- easy to write ? imho a dynamically-typed languages using duck-typing, like Ruby, isn't so easy to use at first when without documentations that are easily-accessible in runtime, since it's hard to offer strong IDEs based on static code analysis. But the Ruby's documentation system doesn't feel like so well-made, at least in the conjunction with runtime information.
- (random thought) in comparison, julia seems to have achieved the productivity that is equivalent (or more) to Ruby, and also the performance as well, so I guess the julia's ecosystem can produce a better alternative to Rails.
