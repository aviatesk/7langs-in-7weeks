## Seven Languages in Seven Weeks - aviatesk

Keeps my notes and code of [7LI7W](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X).

Below is my random thoughts on each language I learned in the book.

### Ruby

- has lots of things in common with julia:
  * `do ... end` (code block) syntax
  * external method definition
  * metaprogramming
- easy to write ? imho a dynamically-typed languages using duck-typing, like Ruby, isn't so easy to use at first when without documentations that are easily-accessible in runtime, since it's hard to offer strong IDEs based on static code analysis. But the Ruby's documentation system doesn't feel like so well-made, at least in the conjunction with runtime information.
- (random thought) in comparison, julia seems to have achieved the productivity that is equivalent (or more) to Ruby, and also the performance as well, so I guess the julia's ecosystem can produce a better alternative to Rails.


### Io

- I agree with that Io is surely simple, but really frustrating to me by its coding style, at least so far ...
- DSLs in Io are fairly powerful, it's definitely possible by the fact that Io stays so simple that it can be implemented without definition lots of tokens for the parser (consequently, Io has less syntax-sugar, which I want to have more in a language).
