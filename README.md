Notes and sandbox scripts of [7LI7W](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X).
My random thoughts on each language follows, but who reads it.


### Ruby

- has lots of things in common with julia:
  * `do ... end` (code block) syntax
  * external method definition
  * metaprogramming (but less powerful than julia's)
- really easy to write ? imho a dynamically-typed languages using duck-typing, like Ruby, isn't actually too easy to use at first, without documentations that are easily-accessible _in runtime_, since it would be hard to offer strong IDE-features (based on static code analysis). But Ruby's documentation system didn't feel so accessible, imho, at least in the conjunction with runtime information.
- (random hope) in comparison, julia seems to have achieved great productivity that is same level as Ruby's, while it's more performant; I hope julia's ecosystem can produce better alternatives to what Ruby has produced, like Rails.


### Io

- I agree with that Io is surely simple, but its coding style felt really frustrating to me, at least so far ...
- DSLs in Io are fairly powerful, it's definitely possible by the fact that Io stays so simple that it can be implemented with less pre-defined tokens for the parser (consequently, Io has less syntax-sugar, which in turn felt unsatisfactory to me).


### Scala
